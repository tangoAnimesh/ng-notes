==========[ life-cycle-hook-or-comp-life-cycle works ]=========
-> Every component in Angular has a life-cycle, a series of diff stages
  that components goes through form initialization to destruction;

-> We can say life-cycle-hooks is a specific funtion that we can call 
   during the specific point of a life of a component in there angular app;

-> This every life-cycle-hooks are implemented by dedicated interfaces which provide angular/core library;


>>> constructor ->  The constructor is a default method in a TS class that automatically gets called when
	                the class is being instantiated;
         -> Constructor always run before any angular hook and it is not a part of 
              Life cycle Hook;
         
         -> It is widely used to inject dependencies(services) into the component class;
         -> called before any hook to inject dependency;
         -> Whenerver any component run it always call constructor at first;

--> Type  of Hooks --> 

> ngOnChanges     -> called after a bound input property changes;
> ngOnInit             -> called once the component is initialized; to initialized any property in component use it; 
> ngDoCheck       -> called during every change detection run;
> ngAfterContentInit    -> called after the ng-content [content projection] has been pojected into view;
> ngAfterContentChecked -> called every time projected content has been checked;
> ngAfterViewInit    --> called after component(child) view has been initialised
> ngAfterViewChecked --> called every time component(child) view has been checked;
> ngOnDestroy        --> called once the component is about to destroy;


---------------------- Diff B/w Constructor and ngOnInit --------------------
	Constructor 			ngOnInit 
1>  It is called before any life cycle	        It is called after ngOnchanges Hooks. 
     hooks.			
2> When constructor called , everything       when ngOnInit called, Everything about 
    in component is not ready , so it's 	     component is already ready, so it's use
   mostly used for injecting dependency      is to perform most of the business logic
   only;				    on component;
3> Constructor is a method od TS class,    ngOnInit is angular life cycle hook,
    It automaticlly gets called when the 	  which signals the activation  of created 
   class is being instantiated;		   component
